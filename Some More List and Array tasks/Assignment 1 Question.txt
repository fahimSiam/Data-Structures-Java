1. Music Chair:
                Suppose you have been hired to develop a musical chair game. In this game there will be 7 
                participants and all of them will be moving clockwise around a set of 7 chairs organizedin 
                a circular manner while a music will be played in the background. You will control the
                music using random numbers between 0-3.If the generated random number is 1, you will
                stop the music and if the number of participants who are still in the game is n, the
                participant at position (n/2) will be eliminated. Each time a participant is eliminated, a
                chair will be removed and you have to print the player names who are still in the game.
                The game will end when there will be only one participant left. At the end of the game,
                display the name of the winner.
2.      Write a method that takes as input a singly linked list and prints the first duplicate
        number.
        public void printDuplicate(Node head){
        //to do
        }
        OR
        def printDuplicate (head):
        pass
        Sample Input Sample Output
        5 → 4 → 15 →2 → 3 → 4 4
        6 → 6 → 10 →10 → 1 →1 → 10 → 6 6
5.      Complete the method below that takes the reference of a non-dummy headed singly
        linear linked list and removes all the nodes containing multiples of 5 from the list.
        remove_multiple_of_five(head)
        Sample Input Sample Output
        5 → 6 → 35 → 10 → 12 → 90 6 →12
        11 → 21 → 3 → 43 → 51 11 → 21 → 3 → 43 → 51
        10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 null
6.    You are given two dummy-headed singly linked lists, write a method to sum the
      integers represented in two different lists. The input lists will have single digits in each
      node. The digits in each node concat to form an integer.
      Sample Input Sample Output
      List 1 : x → 4 → 5 → 3
      List 2 : x → 9 → 5 → 2
      x → 1 → 4 → 0 → 5
      Explanation: List 1 represents the integer 453. List 2 represents the integer 952.
      453+952=1405. Hence, List 3 contains 1 → 4 → 0 → 5.7. Given a non-dummy headed circular list, write down a method for inserting an element
      into the list.
8.     Write down the insertBefore method which inserts a new element in the list before the
        node containing the given element.The method takes as parameters a dummy headed
        doubly linked circular list, the element existing in the list and new element to be added.
        public void insertBefore (Node head, Object elem, Object
        newElement){
        //to do
        }
        OR
        def insertBefore (head, elem, newElement):
        pass
        insertBefore (head, 3, 50)
        Sample Input Sample Output
        ↻ x ⇄1 ⇄ 2 ⇄ 3 ⇄ 4 ↺ ↻ x ⇄1 ⇄ 2 ⇄ 50 ⇄ 3 ⇄ 4
