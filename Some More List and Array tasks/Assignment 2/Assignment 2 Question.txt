    Given base and n that are both 1 or more, compute recursively (no loops) the value of base 
    to the n power, so powerN(3, 2) is 9 (3 squared).
    powerN(3, 1) → 3
    powerN(3, 2) → 9
    powerN(3, 3) → 27

    Suppose, you have been given a non-negative integer which is the height of a ‘house of 
    cards’. To build such a house you at-least require 8 cards. To increase the level (or height) 
    of that house, you would require four sides and a base for each level. Therefore, for the top 
    level, you would require 8 cards and for each of the rest of the levels below you would 
    require 5 extra cards. If you were asked to build level one only, you would require just 8
    cards. Of course, the input can be zero; in that case, you do not build a house at all. 
    Complete the recursive method below to calculate the number of cards required to build 
    a ‘house of cards’ of specific height given by the parameter
    public int hocBuilder (int height){
    // TO DO
    }

        a. Print the following pattern for the given input (you must use recursion):
        Sample Input: 5
        Sample Output:
        1
        1 2
        1 2 3
        1 2 3 4
        1 2 3 4 5
        b. Print the following pattern for the given input (you must use recursion):
        Sample Input: 5
        Sample Output:
                1
              1 2
            1 2 3
          1 2 3 4
        1 2 3 4 5

        Suppose, you are working in a company ‘X’ where your job is to calculate the profit based 
        on their investment. 
        If the company invests 100,000 USD or less, their profit will be based on 75,000 USD as 
        first 25,000 USD goes to set up the business in the first place. For the first 100,000 USD, 
        the profit margin is low: 4.5%. Therefore, for every 100 dollar they spend, they get a profit 
        of 4.5 dollar.
        For an investment greater than 100,000 USD, for the first 100,000 USD (actually on 75,000 
        USD as 25,000 is the setup cost), the profit margin is 4.5% where for the rest, it goes up to 
        8%. For example, if they invest 250,000 USD, they will get an 8% profit for the 150,000 
        USD. In addition, from the rest 100,000 USD, 25,000 is the setup cost and there will be a 
        4.5% profit on the rest 75,000. Investment will always be greater or equal to 25,000 and 
        multiple of 100.
        Complete the RECURSIVE methods below that take an array of integers (investments) 
        and an iterator (always sets to ZERO(‘0’) when the method is initially called) and prints 
        the profit for the corresponding investment. You must avoid loop and multiplication (‘*’) 
        operator. 
        Output:
                1. Investment: 25000; Profit: 0.0
                2. Investment: 100000; Profit: 3375.0
                3. Investment: 250000; Profit: 15375.0
                4. Investment: 350000; Profit: 23375.0
                
7.      Suppose you have two arrays: Arr1 and Arr2. [7 Marks]
        Arr1 will be sorted values. For each element v in Arr2, you need to write a pseudo code that will 
        print the number of elements in Arr1 that is less than or equal to v. 
        For example: suppose you are given two arrays of size 5 and 3 respectively.
        5 3 [size of the arrays]
        Arr1 = 1 3 5 7 9
        Arr2 = 6 4 8 
        The output should be 3 2 4
        Explanation: Firstly, you should search how many numbers are there in Arr1 which are 
        less than 6. There are 1, 3, 5 which are less than 6 (total 3 numbers). Therefore, the answer 
        for 6 will be 3.
        After that, you will do the same thing for 4 and 8 and output the corresponding answers 
        which are 2 and 4. Your searching method should not take more than O (log n) time.
        
 8.       On a boring Friday, you are sitting alone in your room. Due to the lockdown, you cannot 
          go out to play with your friends, so you had nothing to do at home. Suddenly, your little 
          sister comes and tells you that some of your family members want to play an interesting 
          game called “Friday Fun”. Therefore, you decided to join in the game. There are few 
          rules in the game:
          a. All the members that will play the game must sit in a circular manner.
          b. There will be packet that they need to pass.
          c. There will be a dice, which will determine the faith of the player.
          d. If dice after flipping get ‘1 or 6’, the player has to pass the packet to the 
          next player (sitting to his/her right).
          e. If dice after flipping get ‘3 or 5, then the player is in danger but does not 
          get eliminated, so the player has to pass it to the next member (sitting to 
          his/her right).
          f. If dice after flipping get ‘2 or 4, the player gets eliminated and passes the 
          packet to the next player (sitting to his/her right).
          g. The game continues until there is only one member left and he/she will get 
          a surprise gift.
          Write a method that finds out the winner of the ‘Friday Fun’ game, you will be given as 
          input the number of players playing and the dice sequence. [You must use recursion for 
          solving this problem.]
